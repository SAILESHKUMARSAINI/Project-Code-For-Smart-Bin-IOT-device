# Project-Code-For-Smart-Bin-IOT-device
Smart Bin is an IoT-enabled waste management system designed to monitor garbage levels in real time and improve waste collection efficiency. The bin uses sensors to detect fill levels and sends data to a central system/dashboard, enabling timely collection, reduced overflow, and optimized routes for waste management authorities.
